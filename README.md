[Please list the urls for the APIs you used:]

Summary of Program:
my program takes the above urls and implements then into the code to retreive it from the API files ans uses it in the program. 
Most Challenging topic in the course:
Personally, the most challenging topic I would probubly say would be the creating the string, but the most tedious part was making the design and visual aspects of the programs.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
My code does not necessarily output anything of substance but it does identitfy the words cat and dog.

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
I know this code doesnt really work but I had no clue how to implement the urls into the code to make it work and I really tried my best on this but could not seem to get the results I wanted.
